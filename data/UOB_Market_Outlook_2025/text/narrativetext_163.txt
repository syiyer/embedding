We expect the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to deliver only one 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in the second quarter of this year because the US labour market has proven to be more resilient than expected while US President-elect Trump's tariff policy could cause inflation to re-accelerate. Thereafter, we expect the Fed to keep interest rates on hold for the rest of 2025.
