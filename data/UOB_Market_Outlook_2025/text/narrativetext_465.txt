While investor sentiment in Asia ex-Japan may be weighed down by trade tensions, there are still opportunities worth exploring. Companies with a domestic focus, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and utilities, are likely to be less affected by trade uncertainties as compared to those with significant exposure to foreign markets. As reference, during the 2018 US-China trade tensions, both the REITs and utilities sectors delivered positive returns of 10.5%"? and 7.4%" respectively.
