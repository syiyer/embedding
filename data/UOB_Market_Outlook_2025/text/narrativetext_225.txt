Japan has been the outlier where their 2024 policy tightening focus was in response to above-target inflation and higher wage growth. We expect Japan's central bank (BOJ) to raise interest rates by 25 bps to 0.50% in March before keeping rates unchanged for the rest of the year due to external headwinds and domestic political uncertainty. However, there is a possibility the rate hike may be delayed until April or even later as the BOJ may want to gain clarity of US policies and Japan's wage growth trend.
