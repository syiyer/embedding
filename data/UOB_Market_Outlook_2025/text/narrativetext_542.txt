In the US, potentially lighter regulations will enable banks and other financial institutions to allocate their capital more efficiently. This can be via business expansion or increased dividend payouts and/or share buybacks. An avenue of building your investment income can be found in Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds, also known as Contingent Convertible (CoCo) bonds, Tier 2 (T2) bonds and senior Total Loss- Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) bonds. These bonds come with higher risk, so consider your risk appetite before investing.
