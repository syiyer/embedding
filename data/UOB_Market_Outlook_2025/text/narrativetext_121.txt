Inflationary pressures have eased over the past two and a half years, reducing input costs for businesses and easing the cost-of-living squeeze on households. This has allowed many global central banks to turn their focus towards economic growth risks by cutting interest rates. Looking ahead, the risk is that tariffs imposed by the US may cause inflation to re-accelerate, so rate cuts may be cautious and more gradual over this year.
