We retain a positive view on Gold as safe haven demand will likely stay strong given geopolitical risks and potential trade tensions. In addition, consumer demand for physical gold and jewellery remains strong while emerging market central banks may continue to increase their Gold holdings. We expect Gold to rise to USD 3,000 per ounce by the fourth quarter of 2025.
