the coming year in response to a weaker economy. Given weakening growth prospects and with inflation set to slow further, we expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to bring forward pre-emptive interest rate cuts into the first half of the year. We expect 25 bps rate cuts at each of the next four policy meetings, January, March, April and June, to bring the deposit rate down to a neutral level of 2% by the end of the second quarter of 2025. The ECB will likely keep monetary policy unchanged for the second half of the year.
