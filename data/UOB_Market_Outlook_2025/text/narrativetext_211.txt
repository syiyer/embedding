Notably, China's Politburo announced it will pursue a “moderately loose” monetary policy strategy for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis, as compared to the “prudent” policy strategy that has been in place since 2011. China’s top leaders also signalled that fiscal policy will be “more proactive", a hint that fiscal spending will increase in 2025. In addition, Beijing pledged to stabilise the property and stock markets and use more policy tools to boost the economy.
