The outlook for European stock markets is uncertain despite likely rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB). This is due to the Eurozoneâ€™s weak economic momentum while potential trade tensions with the US and China may darken the export outlook. To unlock Europe's growth potential, policy shifts or structural reforms are required but this may not be forthcoming due to political turmoil in Germany and France. As such, though European stock valuations are significantly lower than US peers, we retain a neutral outlook for European stocks given potentially weaker corporate earnings growth.
