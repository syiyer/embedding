The Eurozone economy faces downside risks in the year ahead. This is due to the simultaneous growth slowdown and political uncertainty in Germany and France. This means the two biggest European economies may not be able to support regional growth. Beyond this, a potential escalation in trade tensions with the US also complicates the Eurozone economic outlook, particularly for exporters. US President-elect Trump has already threatened the European Union with tariffs if its member countries do not buy more American oil and gas to lower their trade deficit with the US.
