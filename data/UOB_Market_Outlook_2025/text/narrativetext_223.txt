Investors have ramped up expectations of additional monetary easing by China’s central bank (PBoC) to support the economy against increasing headwinds. However, potential capital outflows driving depreciation pressure on the Chinese Yuan (CNY) means there are limits to how much China can cut interest rates. We think the PBoC will focus on reducing banks’ reserve requirement ratio (RRR) to release long-term liquidity into the financial system and expect another 50 to 100 bps of RRR cuts this year. We also expect a 30 bps cut in total to the benchmark 7-day reverse repo rate and also the 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates (LPR).
