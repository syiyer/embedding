Given economic weakness and a quicker slowdown in inflation, we expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to bring forward 100 bps of rate cuts to the first half of this year, via 25 bps reductions in January, March, April and June. This will lower the deposit rate to a neutral level of 2% by the end of the second quarter of 2025. If rising trade tensions dampen Eurozone exports and economic growth by more than currently expected, the ECB may have to react with even more rate cuts.
