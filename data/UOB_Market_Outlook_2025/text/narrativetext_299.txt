tax cuts and deregulation will support US corporate earnings, while the US economy is set to outperform global peers. That said, US stock market returns are unlikely to be as strong as that seen in 2023 and 2024.

In 2025, other US stocks outside of these mega-caps will likely catch up due to less expensive valuations and more domestic exposure, offering potential for better returns.
