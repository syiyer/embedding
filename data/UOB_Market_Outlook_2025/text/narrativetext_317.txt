The outlook for Asian stock markets is mixed. While potential trade tensions and China's uncertain economic recovery will weigh on Asian stock market sentiment, there are certain positive factors. Asia ex-Japan stock valuations remain attractive, corporate earnings will likely stay robust, while potential fiscal stimulus by China may also mitigate some downside risks. Export-reliant companies will face headwinds, while Asian companies that are less reliant on external trade and focuses more on domestic-oriented businesses may fare comparatively better across this year.
