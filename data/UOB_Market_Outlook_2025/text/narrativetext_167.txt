We acknowledge risks to our interest rate outlook. If trade tensions result in tit-for-tat retaliatory tariffs and countries prioritise a policy of onshoring supply chains, a re-acceleration of inflation in some countries and weaker economic growth in other countries could result in a desynchronised path for global interest rates.
