One of the Trump administration’s top priorities is the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), and to reduce the corporate tax rate from 21% to as low as 15%. These changes could support consumer spending and boost US corporate earnings, driving the stock market higher. As reference, during President-elect Trump's first term, the expectation of tax cuts drove a sharp rally in US stocks across 2017 where the S&P 500 Index gained nearly 22%5, the NASDAQ Composite rose nearly 30%° while the Russell 2000 Index of small-cap stocks delivered nearly 15%’ gains.
