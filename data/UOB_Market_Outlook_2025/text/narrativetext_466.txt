As discussed above, investors should build an income portfolio beyond just cash or fixed deposits. While cash and fixed deposits provide safety, their returns often fail to beat inflation, eroding purchasing power over time. In contrast, an income portfolio that consists of quality bonds and quality dividend stocks can deliver higher long-term returns, with dividend stocks providing the added benefit of compounding wealth effect when dividends are reinvested, thereby accelerating portfolio growth (Figure 11).
