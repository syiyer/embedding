China has announced it intends to pursue a “moderately loose” monetary policy strategy to support an economy facing both domestic and foreign headwinds, suggesting more rate cuts ahead. That said, China faces limits on how much it can cut interest rates as potential capital outflows could drive depreciation pressure on the Chinese Yuan (CNY). Instead of aggressive rate cuts, we think China's central bank (PBoC) will focus on reducing banks’ reserve requirement ratio’ (RRR) by another 50-100 bps this year. We also expect a 30 bps cut in total to the benchmark 7-day reverse repo rate? and also the 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates? (LPR).
