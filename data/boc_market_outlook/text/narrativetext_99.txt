European bonds: The ECB lowered interest rates by 25 bps at its policy meeting in April as expected by the market, which has been the seventh rate reduction since the start of the rate cut cycle in June 2024. According to the policy statement after the meeting, the Eurozone economy is expected to slow down due to heightened market uncertainties that may further affect the economic outlook of the Eurozone, and may continue to rely on data and a meeting-by-meeting approach to decide upon interest rate cuts. Judging from the economic data, although the Eurozone manufacturing PMI rebounded to 49 in April, it remained at a contraction level for 34 consecutive months. In addition, the IMF lowered the Eurozone economic growth forecast for the year 2025 from 1% to 0.8% in the World Economic Outlook released in April, indicating that the Eurozone economy is still weak. Moreover, it is expected by the market that the ECB would continue to lower interest rates in 2025. However, the German 2-year and 10-year bond yields have fallen after hitting year-to-date highs of around 2.314% and 2.938% in March, and once reached low levels of 1.620% and 2.428%, respectively. Against the backdrop of significant declines in European bond yields in a short period of time, coupled with the cooling of risk aversion sentiment in the market over the recent period, the German 2-year and 10-year bond yields have rebounded to about 1.909% and 2.647%. However, the ECB is still in a cycle of rate cuts, and it is expected that European bond yields will still be on a downward channel. At present, Bloomberg Barclays Pan-European Composite Sovereign Bonds and Pan-European Investment-grade Bonds have minimum yields of one standard deviation above the 10-year average, indicating attractive levels of valuation. Therefore, whenever European bond yields rebound, investors may consider increasing asset allocation into European bonds to capture the potential opportunities for bond prices to rise.
