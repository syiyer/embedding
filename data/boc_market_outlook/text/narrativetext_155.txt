Due to the Trump administration’s policies, the USD index has retreated against major currencies across the board, including the USD/JPY, which slipped to around 145 from around 150 in early April. There seem to be signs of pause in the recent trend of de- dollarization in the market, with the USD index and long-term US Treasury prices stabilizing. In June, the USD will remain the key to determining the orientation of the movements of the USD/JPY. From a statistical perspective, the data released by the Japanese government showed that household spending increased by 2.1% year-over-year and 0.4% month-over-month in March, both exceeding the market’s expectations, reflecting a gradual recovery in consumption. Although real wages fell for the third consecutive month (by 2.1% in March), the market’s expectations remain that the trend of wage increases and high inflation will prompt the BoJ to hike interest rates further in 2025.
