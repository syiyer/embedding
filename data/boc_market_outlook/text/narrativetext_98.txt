US bonds: The US 10-year Treasury yield fluctuated by 73 bps in April, and the volatility has been the largest in more than two years. The volatility of bond yields decreased slightly in the first half of May, when the 10-year Treasury yield had recovered from a monthly low of 4.1% to around 4.5%. The Fed kept interest rates unchanged for the third consecutive time at the FOMC meeting in May. From its perspective, the risks of rising inflation and unemployment in the US have intensified, but at the same time, it believes that the current solid job market reflects that the US economy is still solid. Hence, the Fed is not in a hurry to cut interest rates. On the other hand, the latest year-over-year CPI and core CPI growth in April dropped to 2.3% and remained at 2.8% respectively, indicating that the inflation has maintained a downward trend year-to-date. The Fed has become cautious about lowering interest rates due to rising uncertainties about the economic outlook, and the slowdown in inflation has led to a decrease of expectations for interest rate cuts, thus supporting the rise in US Treasury yields. At present, the expectations for rate cuts are subject to the impact of economic growth, inflation and dynamics of the peripheral factors. Prior to evident slowdown of the economy, the Fed is expected to maintain the current interest rate level to curb the inflation that might potentially surge, thus posing constraints to the Fedâ€™s room of rate cuts. As such, investors may leverage short-term US bonds from a tactical perspective to lock in interest rates and to help alleviate the impact on bond prices when interest rates fluctuate.
