Since President Trump announced different policies in April, the GBP has rallied versus the USD but underperformed against half of the other G10 currencies. Despite apparent attempts by the White House to de-escalate situation, uncertainty remains elevated. Such uncertainty has caused currency markets to break from their usual relationship with interest rate differentials. In the clearest display on both ends of the spectrum, US political uncertainty has made GBP a safer haven than the USD (GBP strengthen against USD), but it remains riskier than the EUR (GBP weakens against EUR). The UKâ€™s current account deficit leaves GBP vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. In contrast, Eurozone runs a large current account surplus, generating an excess of capital that is invested in overseas markets. But in times of financial market stress, de-risking can cause capital repatriation supporting the EUR. GBP has often exhibited a negative correlation to gilt yields during a market fall, suggesting some fiscal risk premium remains. While sticky services inflation could keep the Bank of England patient, headwinds are starting to emerge for the currency.
