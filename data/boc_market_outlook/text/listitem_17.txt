= Bond market | In the near term, the US bond market may still experience volatility due to a number of factors. Against such backdrop, it is strategically possible to leverage shorter-term US bonds to lock in interest rates while reducing the impact on bond prices when interest rates fluctuate. Bloomberg Barclays pan-European composite sovereign bonds and pan-European investment-grade bonds have minimum yields of one standard deviation above the 10-year average, indicating attractive levels of valuation.

While market sentiment improved, and the stable and loose market liquidity, there is a relatively high chance for the bond market to experience volatility within a narrow range, and there could be divergent performance between long-term and short-term bonds.

The spread advantages in emerging bond markets are not evident, and investors shall continue to wait for opportunities.
