The risk aversion sentiment has been alleviated in the market. In particular, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index rebounded more than 17% from its April lows to the level at the time of writing, and returned to its level at the end of March. The uptrend is broad-based, with nearly 70% of the index component stocks trading above their 50-day moving averages. The rally has been partly due to the progress of trade talks boosting the market’s sentiment, and partly due to the reassurance given to the market by the ECB’s officials. From the perspective of the chief economist of the ECB, the Eurozone economy is still growing, and there is a low chance for the Eurozone economy to experience a recession due to the trade environment. In addition, according to the ECB, although the economic growth forecast for the year 2024 and 2025 has been revised down to 0.9% and 1.2% respectively. The ECB’s President Christine Lagarde has also stressed the increased downside risks to economic growth. From the aspect of the ECB, the Eurozone economy is slowing down instead of contracting. Moreover, following the BoE’s interest rate cuts in May, it is widely expected by the market that the ECB would lower interest rates again at the policy meeting in June, and the market liquidity is likely to further increase, thus bolstering the economic development and maintaining the trend of European stocks.
