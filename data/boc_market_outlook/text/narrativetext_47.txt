Exports rose by 8.1% year-over-year in April (previous value was 12.4%), while imports fell by 0.2% year-over-year (previous value was 4.3). Exports grew significantly faster than expected, and the trade rush and entrepot trade may be the major contributing factors. Considering the 90-day pause of tariffs, it is expected that the follow-up trade rush will continue in Q2 and Q3. Judging from the historical experience, driven by the support of trade rush, the export growth rate in 2018 remained at a high level. In 2025, importers of China’s goods will be more widely distributed, and the export competitiveness of Chinese products has been significantly improved. As such, China’s exports are likely to remain resilient.
