Driven by the market’s optimism, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan Index rebounded sharply by more than 20% from its lows in early April, and the rebound was mainly driven by Chinese stocks. Elsewhere in Asia, stock markets in Korea, Thailand and Indonesia generally tose. In addition to the development of trade relations, the USD index has repeatedly retreated, bringing financial support to Asian stock markets. For instance, Korea’s Ministry of Finance proposed a KRW 12 trillion worth of supplementary budget plan in mid- April to bolster its export-dependent economy, which is expected to facilitate the development of related businesses. Nevertheless, it shall be noted that the Korean presidential election will be held in June, which may bring uncertainties to fiscal policy and the stock market. As Asian stocks have rebounded quite a bit, both positive and negative news are expected to consistently dominate the stock market performance while bringing volatility to the market.
