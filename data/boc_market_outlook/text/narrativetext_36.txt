With respect to the monetary policy, the ECB has lowered its interest rates seven times since June 2024, bringing the deposit rate to 2.25%. Over the recent period, numerous members of the ECB’s Governing Council have expressed their open attitude towards interest rate cuts in June and beyond, but at the same time, the central bank will closely monitor potential inflationary pressure and signal that further rate cuts should be cautious. This is mainly attributable to global economic uncertainties and the possibility that higher defense spending in Europe could push up inflation in the medium term, or limit the room for monetary policy easing. The market’s expectations for the number of rate cuts by the end of the year have fallen from three in early May to merely two at present (interest rate reduction of 25 bps at each of the time). Overall, the Eurozone economy is in a modest phase of recovery, but the inflationary pressure remains to be a concern. Moving forward, the ECB needs to strike a balance between supporting economic growth and curbing inflation, and attempts to maintain policy flexibility and to make prudent response to potential risks.
