4lnvestment involves risks. It is as likely that losses will be incurred rather than profit made as a result of buying and selling securities, commodities, foreign exchanges, derivatives or other investments. The price of a security may move up or down, and may become valueless. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance. Foreign investments carry additional risks not generally associated with investments in the domestic market, including but not limited to adverse changes in currency rate, foreign laws and regulations (e.g. foreign exchange control). This document does not and is not intended to cover any or all of the risks that may be involved in the securities or investments referred to herein. Investors should read and fully understand all the offering documents relating to such securities or investments and all the risk disclosure statements and risk warnings therein before making any investment decisions.
