With respect to opportunities, every cloud has a silver lining. First, gold is the most certain opportunity among major asset categories. This is the common belief of global funds for “establishing the new before abolishing the old” international economic order. Second, at a certain moment, risk assets are mixed with turbulence, and there is an opportunity for mean reversion brought about by overreaction. It is foreseeable that the fluctuation in US stocks will be transmitted to Internet stocks of Chinese concept shares, and then drag down the irrational and sharp declines of the Hang Seng TECH Index. We tend to focus on the opportunities brought by the oversold Chinese equity assets, including the STAR board and the Hang Seng TECH Index, as well as the opportunities of asset allocation into the oversold US stocks. Third, closer attention shall be paid to the opportunities brought by the development of US policies and the adjustments of the Fed’s policies. Furthermore, it may be too early for opportunities of “establishing the new before abolishing the old” international economic order to arise in Q2, but once the trend is initiated, the capital market will definitely react in advance, thus providing opportunities of investments.
