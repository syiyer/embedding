Besides mitigating trade policy risks, the momentum of the rally in US stocks lies in optimal macroeconomic data in Q1, 2025, as well as the strong corporate earnings performance. Although the real GDP of the US in Q1, 2025 contracted by 0.3% quarter-over-quarter, it grew by 3% in real terms after excluding the disturbance of import hoarding. The US employment remained resilient, with non-farm payrolls exceeding the marketâ€™s expectations in April. Moreover, the unemployment rate remained low at 4.2%, and weekly jobless claims also held steady at around 230,000. The inflation rate returned to the downward channel, and the PCE and core PCE price indices recorded zero month-over-month growth in March, falling to 2.3% and 2.6% year-over-year respectively, further approaching the policy target. The S&P 500 corporate earnings grew by 13.4% year-over-year in Q1, 2025, marking two consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth, and the median full-year earnings growth forecast reached 13%, bolstering the high valuation of US stocks.
