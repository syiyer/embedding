The interest rate decision in May did not convey to the market a clear orientation for the subsequent monetary policy. First, the BoE remains highly sensitive to the current economic environment, and the direction of inflation will depend on the dynamics between the global economy and domestic consumption. Second, members of the Monetary Policy Committee of the BoE have experienced tripartite disagreements. The number of members supporting a 25-bp rate cut continued to account for a slight majority. Moreover, two members were in favour of keeping the current rate unchanged, and two members were in favor of a 50-bp rate cut. Megan Greene, who had previously clearly expressed concerns about the downside in inflation, only supported a 25-bp rate cut. Last but not least, there is also a disagreement between the BoE and the market. Compared with the previous forecast, the BoE believes that the inflation will approach the 2% target sooner, and the national think tank National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) believes that the current tight labor market and the increase in the corporate pricing cap will delay the time for inflation to fall. The BoE will announce its next interest rate decision on June 19, and closer attention shall be paid to the inflation and employment data for April and May.
