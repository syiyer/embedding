Looking forward to June, the market is expected to resume the risk appetite sentiment in the short term. Due to concerns about the impact of the trade policy on the US economy, the market originally expected the Fed to restart monetary easing in June. Against the backdrop of the easing of the trade tension, the pressure to cut interest rates was temporarily eased, and the expectations of two rate cuts were maintained before the end of the year. In the near term, gold prices are subject to adjustments under pressure. Since May, the investorsâ€™ buying intentions have weakened near historical highs. Nevertheless, in the mid-to long-term, the gold market is likely to remain bullish in the long run due to factors including the rate cuts by global central banks, risk aversion and gold purchases by central banks. The easing of global trade tension has imposed certain pressure on gold prices, but the pullback in gold prices has also attracted a lot of bargain buying. As of April, the PBOC has increased its holdings of gold for six consecutive months. In addition, the imminent start of demand for the wedding season in India is expected to drive physical gold purchases, which will support gold prices. At present, the international gold price is fluctuating amid consolidation, and after the break, it may still consistently rise if it could effectively break through the range of oscillations upward.
