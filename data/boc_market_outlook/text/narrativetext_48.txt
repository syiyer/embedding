In a nutshell, although the core CPI continues to rebound month-over-month, the overall price remains low. According to the monetary policy implementation report of the PBOC for Q1, 2025, “with respect to the price control, it is necessary to shift from the previous approach of managing high prices into controlling low prices. from supporting scale expansion into high-quality development, and from anti-monopoly into prevention against disorderly competition”. The policy shift has reflected that low price could be the new norm for a period of time, and greater policy efforts are expected to be made to promote a reasonable price recovery.
