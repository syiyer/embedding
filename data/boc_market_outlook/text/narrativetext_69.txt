The fundamentals of the Eurozone are partly reflected in the recent appreciation of the EUR, which rose to its record high against the USD since 2021 and is around the level of 1.12 at the time of writing. A stronger exchange rate could weaken the attractiveness of European exporters. Moving forward, the progress made in the trade agreements between the EU and other countries and the outlook for the Eurozone economy will be of great focus. In the face of rapidly changing market signals, both positive and negative news will continue to dominate changes of the marketâ€™s sentiment, and after a round of rebound, it is inevitable for European stocks to remain volatile.
