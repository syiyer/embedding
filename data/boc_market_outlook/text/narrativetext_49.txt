Tn general, although exports show resilience to a certain extent, domestic demands still need to be bolstered. According to the Politburo meeting in April, China will “step up efforts to better leverage” more proactive fiscal policy and moderately loose monetary policy, alongside introducing a raft of incremental policies at opportune moments. On May 7, the PBOC announced a 0.5 percentage point RRR cut, a 0.1 percentage point cut in the policy rate, in addition to a 0.25 percentage point cut in the interest rate on all structural monetary policy instruments. It is expected that policy easing will still be the major policy orientation for stimulating domestic demands. Moving forward, closer attention shall be paid to the timing and intensity of subsequent fiscal policies.
