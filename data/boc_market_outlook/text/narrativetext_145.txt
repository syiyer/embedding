Affected by the US trade policy, the USD index fell and remained below the level of 100 in early May until the FOMC meeting in May was concluded and the Joint Statement on China-US Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva was released. In particular, the market optimism supported the rebound of the USD index to the level of 102, close to the 50-day moving average. At the FOMC meeting in May, the Fed signaled that the risks of rising inflation and unemployment in the US had intensified, but it would not be in a hurry to cut interest rates based on the current solid labor market. This is due to the need for the Fed to balance the underlying inflation that may further rise and the likelihood of a downturn in the economy. Judging from the remarks of the chairman of the Fed, the central bank is still vigilant about the trend of inflation, and tends to maintain the current level of interest rates to control the risks of a sharp rise in inflation before the economy slows down evidently. Unless there are signs of weakening of the US economy, the Fed may not consider accelerating the interest rate cuts. The cooling of the expectations of interest rate cuts is likely to support the USD’s advantages in terms of interest rate gap. Nevertheless, against the backdrop of policy uncertainties, it is expected that the market still needs to observe a clearer policy direction to support the USD’s upward trend, and the expectations may continue to fluctuate under the influence of either positive or negative news.
