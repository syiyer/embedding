Driven by the declines in the USD index, the EUR briefly rose to a record high since 2021 in April and has since retreated. Compared with the US, the market is less concerned about the Eurozone economy, and varying officials of the ECB have expressed that although the economy is slowing, there is a relative low chance for the Eurozone economy to experience a recession due to the trade environment. At the same time, inflation in Europe at the production and consumer levels is expected to fall back to the target level of 2% in a sustained and stable manner, thus supporting the ECB to consistently cut interest rates to bolster the economy. According to the interest rate futures market, the ECB still has a chance of over 80% to lower interest rates again at its policy meeting in June. While lower interest rates may reduce the attractiveness of the EUR, a relatively positive economic outlook is likely to limit the EURâ€™s downside movements.
