In addition, Japanese stocks have experienced a V-shaped reversal from April to early May, with overseas investors becoming vital contributors. In particular, the overseas investors have been engaged in the net purchases of Japanese stocks and investment funds worth of JPY 3.68 trillion in April, hitting the third highest level on record. The BoJ kept interest rates unchanged and postponed expectations for the timing of achieving its inflation target, thus weakening the JPY. Investment banks have delayed the expectations for the timing of the next rate hike to be adopted by the BoJ. The overnight swaps market suggests a less than 40% chance of a rate ike by the end of the year, significantly lower than in early April. The BoJ’s dovish policy indicates that the policy focus has shifted from domestic issues to potential trade policy implications. In addition, thanks to the improvement in the performance of the manufacturing sector, the reform of the Oriental Stock Exchange, and the undervaluation of Japanese stocks due to the depreciation of the JPY, Japanese stocks have gradually become more attractive for investors, and started to compete with China A-shares and Indian stocks for investment funds in Asia. Japan’s Ministry of Finance has requested China to expand the quota for overseas securities investment so that funds could flow to the Japanese stock market. Major Japanese investment companies are seizing the opportunities brought about by global capital outflow from the US for reallocation of assets. These companies are proactively expanding their overseas Japanese stock sales network, which is likely to bolster the performance of Japanese stocks in the long run.
