Looking forward to June 2025, crude oil prices are driven by demands and are expected to be restored. On the demand side, China’s trade data in April saw supportive signs, with the growth of exports exceeding the market’s expectations and the declines of imports narrowing. Despite declines in crude imports from March, they still rose by 7.5% year-over-year, thanks to the replenishment of inventories by state-owned refineries during plant maintenance. These data suggest that demands continued to be resilient, which could stabilize short-term expectations of oil prices as concerns over global demands persist. At the same time, the EIA raised its forecast for global crude oil demands in 2025, expecting global oil demands to reach 103.7 million bpd in 2025, compared with the previous forecast of 103.6 million bpd. On the supply side, numerous factors are still likely to limit the rise in oil prices. The OPEC bloc continued to signal increased production. However, some oil-producing countries’ actual production declined, offsetting planned increases in other regions. The mixed situation of the OPEC+ alliance has provided support for oil prices at bottom in the near term, especially as demand-side confidence continued to grow. However, due to the Trump administration’s policy, immigration control and other measures, the inflation is likely to rise in H2, 2025, further posing constraints to the Fed’s room of lowering interest rates. The Fed’s “hawkish” stance overall has led to a general reduction in the expectations of interest rate cuts, and the USD index is expected to remain strong, suppressing oil prices.
