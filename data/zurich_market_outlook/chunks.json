    "text": "3 June 2025  \nThe uncertainty is certain  \nThe S&P 500 has recouped all of its losses since President Trump announced far-reaching tariffs on April 2 and even climbed back into positive territory for the year. Investors have become increasingly confident that the worst fallout of the trade war lies behind us and that any potential impact on the economy seems manageable. The probability of a US recession has been significantly reduced with President Trump postponing most of the tariffs and substantially lowering the remaining ones, particularly those affecting imports from China. Nevertheless, the potential risks and the elevated uncertainty persist which could weigh on financial markets in the coming months. Timing, level and duration of any tariffs are highly unpredictable as Trump’s recent threat and eventual postponement to impose a 50% tariff on imports from the EU shows. Many companies did not give any guidance during their recent earnings announcements, emphasising the challenging situation for many corporates  \nThe US Court of International Trade’s ruling that the Trump administration does not have the authority to impose most of the announced tariffs that were implemented using emergency powers shows that Trump’s tariff war is built on shaky ground. The Court of Appeals allowed the tariffs to temporarily stay in place, however, and different legal measures could be used if the current ones are deemed unapplicable, making any spending and investment plans for both households and firms very challenging. Accordingly, small businesses’ capital expenditure plans have fallen to the lowest level since April 2020 when Covid-induced uncertainty weighed on the global outlook.  \nAs growth worries have moved to the background following the postponement of most of the announced tariffs, investors have increasingly focused on the sustainability of the fiscal situation in the US. The tax bill that is currently working its way through Congress, having passed in the House of Representatives by the thinnest of margins and now moved on to the Senate, does nothing to reduce the fiscal deficit that is still hovering around an unsustainably high 6% of GDP. Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating a few weeks ago put the topic back on top of investors’ minds. Yields on 30yr Treasuries have risen above 5% for the first time since 2023 and are now hovering at levels rarely seen since 2007. Rising real yields will provide an additional headwind to the growth outlook at a time when uncertainty weighs on consumers, businesses and investors alike"

    "text": "Investor sentiment has turned more positive as the Trump administration has backed down on a number of critical issues, including trade and the Fed’s independence. While still elevated, tariffs have been rolled back substantially, significantly reducing the risk of a US recession which supported equities globally. Nevertheless, although the outlook is more balanced, risks and the uncertainty around US trade policy remain high which could weigh on financial markets in the coming months.  \nThe tax bill that is currently working its way through the US Congress and Moody's downgrade of the US credit rating have put the fiscal situation back into focus with long-term rates tising close to the highest levels in more than a decade. We do expect government bond yields to decline over time, particularly if economic growth is slowing as predicted, but they are at risk of a further squeeze higher. Credit markets remain vulnerable to growth and interest rate tisks, but spreads are off extreme tights.  \nEconomic activity weakens in Q2 as manufacturing decelerates sharply in response to tariff disruptions  \ne CPI inflation falls to zero amid currency strength, domestic price pressures remain a touch stronger  \ne Following the US-China trade de-escalation, pressure on the SNB to cut rates further has eased; domestic demand remains resilient  \nEconomic activity was strong in Qi, with GDP up 0.8% QoQ (sports adjusted), boosted by front-loading of exports ahead of US tariffs. Since then, growth momentum in the manufacturing sector has weakened, as shown by the PMI survey, with a very sharp downshift in the backlog of orders component since March. While some of the weakness should unwind, given the highly diversified and specialised nature of Swiss exports, US tariff policy will be decisive for the outlook, with elevated uncertainty and the strong franc as additional headwinds. In this environment, it is encouraging that domestic demand is continuing to expand at a healthy clip, supported by the lower rate environment and targeted policy measures to soften the tariff impact."

    "text": "Growth slipped in Q1, dragged down by weak exports, soaring imports, and stagnant consumer spending. Core and headline CP! continued to rise and skyrocketing rice prices, while not alarming the BoJ, have dented PM Ishiba’s approval ratings. External headwinds loom as US tariffs on the auto industry hammer business sentiment. Meanwhile, a sharp jump in 3Oyr and 40yr JGB yields has raised concerns about rising debt service costs amid a heavy government debt load. However, it appears to be a short-term imbalance between supply and demand that can be repaired with adjustments in issuance. There seems to be no systemic risk for now. While the TOPIX traded 5% higher in May, we think equities will continue to face headwinds given a stronger JPY and imminent growth and earnings risks. The US and China agreed to a 90-day trade truce, slashing tariffs by 115%, a surprise move that gave markets a quick lift. However, with talks still bumpy, the exuberance has waned somewhat. Domestically, China continues to grapple with weak consumer spending and a sluggish property market. On the bright side, exports and factory output held up better than expected in April, thanks to stockpiling by foreign buyers and trade being rerouted through third countries. The PBoC cut key rates and RRR, as widely expected, while government bond issuance surged, likely reflecting efforts to clean up hidden local government debt. While market excitement has cooled, Chinese stocks, especially tech-heavy H-shares, still look attractive with light"

While market excitement has cooled, Chinese stocks, especially tech-heavy H-shares, still look attractive with light positioning and cheap valuations while building on a positive Al story. Q1 GDP expanded by 7.4% YoY, significantly above the consensus estimate of 6.8%. However, the upside surprise was largely driven by a sharp rise in net indirect taxes, suggesting the boost may be temporary. GVA, which better reflects underlying economic activity, rose 6.8%, a modest improvement from 6.5% in the previous quarter. While growth is firming, it remains below last year’s peak that fuelled investor optimism around India’s structural growth story. With inflation contained, we expect the RB! to deliver another 50bps in rate cuts on top of the 50bps already cut this year to further support growth. The NIFTY has begun to recover following a period of consolidation. Still, elevated valuations and global uncertainties are likely to contain equity upside. The MSCI LatAm Index advanced 0.9% in May, a mild increase compared to April’s outstanding performance and the rally observed in American stock indices last month. Nevertheless, on a YTD basis, LatAm stocks continue to outperform (+20%), surpassing both EM and DM markets, reaffirming that the region has been one of the least affected by Trump’s disruptive trade agenda but also benefitting from idiosyncratic factors. Mexico continues to outshine, given its improved outlook for access to the US market relative to the rest of the world. Brazilian economic resilience has been supportive for stocks, while the Chilean equity market is benefitting from growing expectations of a market-friendly shift ahead of November's presidential election."
