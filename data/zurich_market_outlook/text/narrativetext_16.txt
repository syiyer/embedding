The tax bill that is currently working its way through the US Congress and Moody's downgrade of the US credit rating have put the fiscal situation back into focus with long-term rates tising close to the highest levels in more than a decade. We do expect government bond yields to decline over time, particularly if economic growth is slowing as predicted, but they are at risk of a further squeeze higher. Credit markets remain vulnerable to growth and interest rate tisks, but spreads are off extreme tights.
