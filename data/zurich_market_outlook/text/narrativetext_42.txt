The US and China agreed to a 90-day trade truce, slashing tariffs by 115%, a surprise move that gave markets a quick lift. However, with talks still bumpy, the exuberance has waned somewhat. Domestically, China continues to grapple with weak consumer spending and a sluggish property market. On the bright side, exports and factory output held up better than expected in April, thanks to stockpiling by foreign buyers and trade being rerouted through third countries. The PBoC cut key rates and RRR, as widely expected, while government bond issuance surged, likely reflecting efforts to clean up hidden local government debt. While market excitement has cooled, Chinese stocks, especially tech-heavy H-shares, still look attractive with light positioning and cheap valuations while building on a positive Al story.
