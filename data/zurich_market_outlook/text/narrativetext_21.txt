Economic activity was strong in Qi, with GDP up 0.8% QoQ (sports adjusted), boosted by front-loading of exports ahead of US tariffs. Since then, growth momentum in the manufacturing sector has weakened, as shown by the PMI survey, with a very sharp downshift in the backlog of orders component since March. While some of the weakness should unwind, given the highly diversified and specialised nature of Swiss exports, US tariff policy will be decisive for the outlook, with elevated uncertainty and the strong franc as additional headwinds. In this environment, it is encouraging that domestic demand is continuing to expand at a healthy clip, supported by the lower rate environment and targeted policy measures to soften the tariff impact.
