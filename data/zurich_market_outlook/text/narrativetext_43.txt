Q1 GDP expanded by 7.4% YoY, significantly above the consensus estimate of 6.8%. However, the upside surprise was largely driven by a sharp rise in net indirect taxes, suggesting the boost may be temporary. GVA, which better reflects underlying economic activity, rose 6.8%, a modest improvement from 6.5% in the previous quarter. While growth is firming, it remains below last year’s peak that fuelled investor optimism around India’s structural growth story. With inflation contained, we expect the RB! to deliver another 50bps in rate cuts on top of the 50bps already cut this year to further support growth. The NIFTY has begun to recover following a period of consolidation. Still, elevated valuations and global uncertainties are likely to contain equity upside.
