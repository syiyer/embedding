The MSCI LatAm Index advanced 0.9% in May, a mild increase compared to April’s outstanding performance and the rally observed in American stock indices last month. Nevertheless, on a YTD basis, LatAm stocks continue to outperform (+20%), surpassing both EM and DM markets, reaffirming that the region has been one of the least affected by Trump’s disruptive trade agenda but also benefitting from idiosyncratic factors. Mexico continues to outshine, given its improved outlook for access to the US market relative to the rest of the world. Brazilian economic resilience has been supportive for stocks, while the Chilean equity market is benefitting from growing expectations of a market-friendly shift ahead of November's presidential election.
