The hard data versus soft data conundrum is still in full swing. The ISM non- manufacturing leading indicator dropped into contraction territory, with consumer sentiment data also remaining downbeat. Yet, hard data from the US labor market — while showing some cracks (US jobless claims rising to 247,000) — seems to be holding up overall. Non-farm payrolls increased by 139,000 in May, with business services shedding jobs compared to prior month. Average hourly earnings increased to 3.9%, with unemployment remaining at 4.2%.
