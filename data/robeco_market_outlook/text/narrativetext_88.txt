Markets and the US consumer have detected there is order in the Trumpian policy chaos evidenced by the surging popularity of the acronym TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) in recent weeks. After the 10 April pause on implementing universal reciprocal tariffs (the pause ending by 8 July), Trump in May announced a reduction in reciprocal tariffs on China for the next 90 days to 10% from the earlier 34% in April. Nonetheless, the 20% fentanyl penalty remains in place, as well as pre-existing tariffs on China. On 27 May, a 50% reciprocal tariff on all imports from the EU was also delayed. The path towards de-escalation is clearly there.
