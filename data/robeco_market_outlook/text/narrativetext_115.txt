ECB President Christine Lagarde delivered a “hawkish” 25 bps rate cut on 5 June. The ECB lowered its 2026 inflation forecast due to a strong euro and lower commodity prices. In our view, a 1.6% CPI reading for 2026 might underestimate the reflationary potential from huge defense spending and a continued recovery in domestic consumption. The June NATO summit in The Hague will likely confirm our monthly theme of a defense renaissance on the European continent.
