Additional information for investors with residence or seat in the Republic of Chile Neither Robeco nor the Funds have been registered with the Comisién para el Mercado Financiero pursuant to Law no. 18.045, the Ley de Mercado de Valores and regulations thereunder. This document does not constitute an offer of or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Funds in the Republic of Chile, other than to the specific person who individually requested this information on their own initiative. This may therefore be treated as a “private offering” within the meaning of Article 4 of the Ley de Mercado de Valores (an offer that is not addressed to the public at large or to a certain sector or specific group of the public).
