US inflation releases for April were lower, but the Federal Reserve will remain wary of inflation expectations as tariff effects feed through: early signs of rising input cost were evident in the US manufacturing and services PMI/ISM data and May wage data were higher. Eurozone inflation fell below 2% in May as Easter effects unwound and lower energy prices and a stronger euro should mean it falls further, even if global food prices (dairy and meat) continue to edge higher. The European Central Bank (ECB) is in a good place after cutting interest rates to 2%, which could prove to be the last cut of the cycle, but we still see disinflationary effects against a backdrop of already low inflation driving policy rates lower across Asia, except Japan.
