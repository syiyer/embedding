Trade uncertainty still reigns though, following the US Court of International Trade (CIT) ruling that the US President had overstepped his authority by imposing reciprocal tariffs globally using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). While the US administration immediately lodged an appeal and won a temporary ‘stay’ on the CIT’s order to remove the IEEPA tariffs, US importers and consumers, as well as foreign exporters, cannot know whether some tariffs will be sustained or cancelled after the appeal, or even increased post 9 July.
