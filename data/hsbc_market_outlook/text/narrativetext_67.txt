There is no guarantee that sustainable investments will produce returns similar to those which don't consider these factors. Sustainable investments may diverge from traditional market benchmarks. In addition, there is no standard definition of, or measurement criteria for sustainable investments, or the impact of sustainable investments (â€œsustainability impact"). Sustainable investment and sustainability impact measurement criteria are (a) highly subjective and (b) may vary significantly across and within sectors.
