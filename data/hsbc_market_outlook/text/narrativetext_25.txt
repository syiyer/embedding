Yields have now edged lower again amid a few signs that the hard US data, which have generally still been more resilient than surveys, may finally be softening a touch. Non-farm payrolls increased at a slightly slower pace in May, while unemployment remained unchanged at 4.2%. Although layoffs in the US remain low, the rate of hiring has slowed. In Europe and in parts of Asia Q1 GDP was stronger than expected, helped by frontloading ahead of tariffs, but Q2 industrial data are mostly showing signs of softening.
