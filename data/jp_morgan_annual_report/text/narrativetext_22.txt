The labor market, while facing challenges such as recent hurricanes and strikes, is expected to remain healthy, with continued job gains and a stable unemployment rate at close to 4%. Employment growth has moderated and may stabilize at a monthly pace of 100,000 to 150,000, consistent with moderate employment growth and a down-shift in immigration. As the labor market normalizes, so too should the inflation rate. We anticipate headline PCE inflation to close the year at 2.3%, and then average 2.0% next year. Altogether, we expect real GDP to expand 2.1% year-over- year in 2025, marking its fifth consecutive year of expansion.
