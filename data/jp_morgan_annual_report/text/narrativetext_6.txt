Over the past four years, the U.S. and global economy and markets have weathered a myriad of challenges, including: the pandemic-induced distortions in manufacturing and services activity, acute supply chain and labor force disruptions due to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the resulting global inflation surge, rapid and coordinated central bank policy tightening - and the impacts on real economic growth, labor markets, consumer and producer prices and earnings growth. Yet, through these cyclical storms, the U.S. economy has maintained an above-average pace of real economic growth and risk assets have delivered strong returns above and beyond those found in cash. As 2024 was ending, these cyclical forces were making their way out of the economy and profits, with a normalization in real economic growth, job creation, inflation pressure and earnings growth - as well as the level of interest rates.
