While investors are likely to be myopically focused on the pace and magnitude of rate cuts next year, investors should take a step back and recognize that the Fed is still in cutting mode in 2025, with the bar to pause cuts or to raise rates set extremely high. However, if the Fed felt that the incoming administration would push through policies that lead to higher federal deficits and supply- side constraints that could boost inflation, they might consider a pause in their easing plans. That said, getting rates to neutral appears to be top priority, suggesting it’s unlikely policy rates fall below 3% outside of recession. Importantly, rates have returned to the pre-Global Financial Crisis “normal” of positive real rates. Given this, reinvestment risk in short-term bonds is high and investors will need to consider other areas of fixed income to achieve their income and return goals.
