Altogether, markets are curren earnings growth to accelerate ly expecting S&P 500 rom 0% in 2023 to 9% this year, followed by an impressive 15% in 2025 and 13% in 2026. We expect earnings growth will be robust and more broad-based, but if GDP growth normalizes towards trend, as we expect, then consensus estimates could be overly optimistic unless a broad-based corporate tax cut is delivered. However, any benefit from a corporate tax cut could be at least partially offset by weakness of multinational performance and a stronger dollar from proposed tariffs. If mid single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth were achieved, it would hinge upon continued economic resiliency, revenue growth and the other 493 companies pulling their weight.?
