We began the year expecting international equities to catch up to the U.S., given the extreme valuation discount to the U.S., expectation of a weaker dollar and the better earnings backdrop. While international equities are up a robust 7% so far in 2024, the gap with the U.S. remains significant. Additionally, with the pro- U.S. policies of the next administration, especially those that promote a stronger dollar (through higher rate differentials and tariff uncertainty), some headwinds are increasing for international stocks.
