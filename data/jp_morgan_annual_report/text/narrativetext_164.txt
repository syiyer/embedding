For alternatives, the outcome-oriented approach toward portfolio construction is particularly relevant, with each major component - commodities, hedge funds, real assets and private capital - solving for one or more “problems.” This will be particularly true looking forward, with stretched valuations challenging future returns, income opportunities fading as rates fall and stock/ bond correlations remaining positive in the absence of a recession, and will complement cyclical, structural tailwinds for the asset class like a normalizing rate environment. These assets will also become increasingly approachable, as technology “democratizes” access through lower minimum investments and greater liquidity. For this reason, the traditional stock/bond framework of “60/40” may be reformed into one that also includes alternative assets: a “50/30/20” portfolio, for example, with the 20% allocation to alternatives financed to varying degrees by both stocks and bonds.
