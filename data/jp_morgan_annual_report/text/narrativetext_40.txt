The Federal Reserve kicked off this easing cycle with a jumbo 50 basis point (bp) rate cut and appears committed ‘o continue lowering interest rates at a reduced quarter percent pace to return to neutral. At time of writing, the committee has already delivered 7Sbps worth of cuts, owering policy rates from 5.25%-5.50% to 4.50%-4.75%; however, a data-dependent Fed suggests the outlook for further easing remains uncertain. What does appear certain is the committee's desire to lower rates byenough ‘0 ease restriction on the economy, but not by too much to encourage inflation. This goal is, of course, very difficult to achieve, but slowing, yet stable growth and easing price pressures provide runway for continued cuts through 2025.
