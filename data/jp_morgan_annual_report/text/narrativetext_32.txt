On the tax front, a full extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the potential for a lower corporate tax rate for U.S.-based production seem most likely. Slim majorities in the Senate and House may limit a full implementation of proposed tax measures, but there could still be some items folded in on business tax provisions, tip income and the cap on SALT deductions. Regardless of any tariff budgetary offsets the administration may propose, these policies are likely to increase the deficit without significantly stimulating economic activity, adding to the nationâ€™s long-term fiscal challenges.
