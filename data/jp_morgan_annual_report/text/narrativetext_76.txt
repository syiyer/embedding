Underneath the surface, the composition of earnings is projected to shift as well. Earnings growth for the Mag 7 is expected to decelerate to a (still solid) 20% annual pace, while accelerating for the rest of the market (Exhibit 3). Al will continue to be a focal point, but the conversation is becoming more balanced with return-on-investment concerns weighed against impressive profits and cash flow generation. This is already reverberating in a more inclusive rally. The Mag accounted for 63% of S&P 500 returns in 2023, and that share has stepped down to 47% so far this year.
