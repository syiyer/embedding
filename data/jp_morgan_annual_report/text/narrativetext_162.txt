n equities, strong earnings growth from the “Magnificent 7” over the past two years has exacerbated an already powerful period of growth outperformance, leaving investors underweight other markets. While U.S. equity portfolios seem to have equal exposure to value and growth when approached at the index level, an analysis of underlying holdings shows a 10%pt overweight to growth.

This translates into a 20% average allocation within equity portfolios to international assets, roughly half of what is considered “diversified.”
