Fed rate cuts tend to lead to higher rate volatility as evidenced in previous rate-cutting cycles. Moreover, we see the long end of the curve being influenced by next yearâ€™s fiscal policy discussions, as well as potential inflationary impacts. With that said, yields have recently backed up and we believe long-term interest rates as measured by the nominal U.S. 10-year Treasury yield should be biased modestly lower from current levels (a beit with intra-year volatility). We see the 10-year yield stabilizing between 3.75%-4.25% in a soft landing scenario, which remains Our base case, and below 3.5% ina hard landing scenario.
