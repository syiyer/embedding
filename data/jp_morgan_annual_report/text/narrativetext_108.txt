Meanwhile, compelling structural stories are driving impressive returns in certain markets (Exhibit 5): Japan, India and Taiwan, up 7%, 13% and 33% respectively. Japan, for instance, is moving out of along period of deflation, stagnant nominal growth and negative rates. In the year ahead, reflation should support consumer spending and domestic earnings more broadly. Japan’s corporate governance reforms, leading to record- high buyback announcements and more M&A activity, should continue supporting flows and returns as its valuation discount fades. However, yen volatility has increased due to “yen carry trade” unwinds and higher U.S. rate expectations, hurting sentiment and equity returns. Looking ahead, yen stability, which is crucial for internationally exposed companies and foreign investors, is expected to improve as Japanese interest rates normalize gradually and yen short positions close. There is risk of a more disruptive rise in U.S. 10-year yields driven by deficit and inflation concerns.
