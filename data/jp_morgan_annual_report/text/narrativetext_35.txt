Policy forecasts at this stage are still highly speculative, but they don’t seem to spell disaster for the economy or markets in the short run. In the coming months, investors will look for greater clarity on the new administration’s agenda, which will help refine the economic outlook. Until then, the economy remains on stable footing as we enter the new year, with a gradual return to normal across many fronts. However, investors should remain vigilant, considering the fragility of the economic expansion that underpins a bullish fervor in markets.
