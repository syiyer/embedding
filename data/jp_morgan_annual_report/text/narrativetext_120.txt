Looking ahead, international equities should benefit from multiple expansion and better earnings growth expectations (Exhibit 6). However, there are plenty of risks, including disappointing economic growth in China, higher U.S. 10-year yields, a strong dollar, tariffs and local currency volatility. In particular, the impact of tariffs on the already fragile global economy will hinge on the timing, scope and execution by the incoming U.S. administration. Increasing tariffs on China could speed up nearshoring activities, while a universal tariff could have significant repercussions for major U.S. trade partners with which it has trade deficits, including Mexico, Europe, Canada and Vietnam. Despite the risks, international equities offer investors the chance to diversify beyond expensive U.S. markets. Adopting an active approach is crucial for capturing attractive opportunities fueled by powerful long-term trends, while also skillfully maneuvering through the policy fog ahead.
