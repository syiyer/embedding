An area of potential economic concern is the incoming Trump administrationâ€™s stance on tariffs. President-elect Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on all imports anda 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, which could be interpreted as a bargaining tool in trade negotiations. If these tariffs were enacted as stated, they could lead to higher inflation and reduce overall demand, as well as higher interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar. According to a recent estimate by the Budget Lab at Yale, these tariffs would raise consumer prices by 1.4% to 5.1% before substitution, equivalent to the cost of $1,900 to $7,600 in disposable income for the average household."
