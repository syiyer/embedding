Embrace credit for the yield, not the spread: We like high-quality duration in securitized markets like agency MBS and asset-backed securities. We also favor the full spectrum of corporate credit (IG, high yield, bank loans and convertible bonds). These sectors would benefit in a soft landing scenario and continue to provide attractive yields even though spreads remain tight.
