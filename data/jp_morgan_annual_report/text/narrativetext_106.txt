Europe is also facing its own cyclical challenges. A shift in sentiment and earnings for European equities will depend largely on a rebound in China, a manufacturing upturn or stronger consumer spending - all challenging to overcome in 2025. Additional European Central Bank (ECB) easing should eventually provide some support, especially for businesses that rely more on bank lending, but confidence and consumer spending have been slow to improve. Additionally, the eurozone may be hit by tariffs next year, as the region struggles to provide a proactive unified response. However, sector-level discounts, combined with healthy buybacks and dividend yields, present compelling opportunities in select European companies.
