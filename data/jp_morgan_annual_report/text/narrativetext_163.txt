These underweights are too severe: geopolitical uncertainty, currency headwinds and widening growth differentials could make strong and sustained foreign market performance illusive, though multiple expansion and improvements to earnings growth, coupled with a focus on long-term trends, should allow ex-U.S. markets to compete. Moreover, with inflation easing and borrowing costs falling, U.S. earnings growth should broaden out and will likely include value names, which as an added benefit are also attractive to income- seeking investors, especially as bond yields continue to normalize. That said, the pendulum should not swing too far: large cap U.S. growth names, including the “Magnificent 7,” still have strong secular tailwinds behind them. In other words, portfolios should be balanced.
