However, the U.S. economyâ€™s momentum is downshifting into a more normal pace. While this alone is unlikely to trigger a recession, it does leave the economy more vulnerable to shocks, including those from significant policy changes that might be coming from Washington this coming year.

As the cyclical storm passes but the policy fog settles in, the number one action call for investors is to ensure portfolios are rebalanced after a few very abnormal years.
