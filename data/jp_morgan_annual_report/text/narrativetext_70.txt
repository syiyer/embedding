In 2024, earnings growth was primarily driven by profit margin expansion from the mega-cap tech names. As the inflation, wage growth and supply chain issues that plagued profitability in 2022 continue to abate, margin recovery should broaden with health care and consumer discretionary seeing notable improvement. However, the contribution to earnings from margins should normalize, and disinflation could also add some pressure by constraining pricing power. Buybacks should also remain tame as companies increasingly use excess Capital to invest in their businesses rather than return it to shareholders. As such, revenue growth will be an increasingly important driver of future returns.
