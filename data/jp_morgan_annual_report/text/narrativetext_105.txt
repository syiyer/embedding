Despite coordinated stimulus leading to a 30% tactical rebound in Chinese equities in 3Q, China remains stuck in its cyclical storm. Policy will likely remain accommodative until economic momentum stabilizes, but policymakers do not seem intent on generating strong growth. Therefore, in 2025, investors may be disappointed by the scale of fiscal policy stimulus and hence overall economic growth. In the case of full implementation of President-elect Trump's tariff campaign promises, Chinese policymakers may stimulate the economy more forcefully; however, this remains uncertain. As a result, investors may be unwilling to pay a higher multiple for Chinese stocks after the recent rally. Pockets of opportunities do exist, particularly among private companies prioritizing shareholder returns and belonging to innovative sectors linked to business technology (automation, software) the renewable energy and electric vehicle supply chain.
