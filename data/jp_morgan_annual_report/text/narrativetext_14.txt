Interest rate-sensitive sectors continued to face challenges but began to stabilize as interest rates peaked. The scope of its acceleration will depend on how much long-end yields move lower next year. Residential investment contracted in 2Q and 3Q as homebuilder sentiment struggled under elevated long-term interest rates, which may persist even as the Fed lowers the federal funds rate. The manufacturing sector, grappling with slow global demand, has also experienced weak job growth and new order activity. However, potential rate cuts could stimulate activity in these sectors, thereby broadening support for GDP growth.
