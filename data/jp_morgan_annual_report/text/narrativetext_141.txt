Unlike real estate, private credit has yet to see a cyclical correction. Defaults have trended higher in recent quarters but remain low, although elevated amend-and- extend activity points to a building credit cycle (Exhibit 8). Moreover, increased bank lending, which could be further boosted by deregulation in the banking industry, could force direct lenders to focus on lower quality borrowers, pressuring default rates higher. That said, while returns may retreat alongside policy rates, investors searching for enhanced yields should continue to find them in private credit.
