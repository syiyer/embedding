The Fed will likely keep rates unchanged in its May meeting. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell may adopt a more dovish tone should weaker jobs data outweigh inflation concerns linked to the tariffs. We maintain our view for the Fed to cut 50 basis points (bps) by end-2025 but acknowledge the potential of more aggressive easing as priced in by the market. Other central banks in Europe, China as well as ASEAN may also ease to support growth though the Bank Japan may hike rates instead due to inflationary pressures.
