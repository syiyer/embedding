Within Asia, we retain a defensive stance with a preference for IG over HY credits and a focus on sectors like utilities, telecommunications, and consumer staples for more resilient yield. We also favour selected Asia insurers with strong branding that could benefit from the structural demand for insurance products in the region. Meanwhile, Singapore REITs (S-REITs) will likely enjoy lower borrowing costs amid the prospect of further monetary easing. Notably, retail REITS would likely be less affected by the tariff uncertainty given the more stable domestic exposure.
