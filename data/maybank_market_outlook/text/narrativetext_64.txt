Investors should note that income from and/or values of such Products, if any, may fluctuate and that each Product's price or value may rise or fall depending on market conditions. Accordingly, investors may receive back less than what they have originally invested or they may also not receive back anything at all from what they have originally invested (i.e. loss of the entire sum invested). All investments involve an element of risk, including capital and principal loss. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to or an indication of future performance. Any scenarios, assumptions, historical or simulated performances, indicative prices or examples of potential transactions or returns are for illustrative purposes only. Maybank does not guarantee the underlying investment, the principal or return on investments.
