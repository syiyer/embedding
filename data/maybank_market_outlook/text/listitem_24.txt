U.S. 1Q GDP fell at an annualised rate of 0.3%, largely due to a surge in imports ahead of President Donald Trump's “Liberation Day” tariff announcements. While we expect at least a partial roll- back of the announced tariffs, the probability of a U.S. stagflation has increased given the policy uncertainty. Nevertheless, Trump’s seemingly softer trade stance suggests he does have a pain threshold, which will help limit the risk of a recession. The Trump administration may also start to discuss more pro-growth measures including de-regulation and tax cuts in 2H25.
