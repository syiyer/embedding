While the heightened volatility in IOY UST yield has raised concerns, we believe it is premature to conclude that USTs have lost the status as a safe-haven asset. The gradual de-leveraging of related hedge fund positioning should also provide stability to the Treasury market. As such, we continue to view USTs as a resilient source of carry, alongside selected Investment Grade (IG) bonds as well as Sukuk. However, we remain less sanguine about HY credits with spreads remaining below the 5-year historical average levels despite the increased growth risks.
