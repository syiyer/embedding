Core scenario (soft landing, 50% probability): The US-China trade truce has reduced the chance of a US economic hard landing. Although still-elevated tariffs will slow growth and lift inflation, the focus will move to trade deals, tax cuts and deregulation. We expect the resulting improvement in consumer and business sentiment to help the US avert a recession. As the job market cools, we expect the Fed to cut rates by 75bps over the next 12 months, starting from H2. Meanwhile, fiscal and monetary policy easing in China and Europe (especially Germany) should broaden growth beyond the US.
