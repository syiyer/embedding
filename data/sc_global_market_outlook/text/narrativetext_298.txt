From a fundamental standpoint, oil markets continue to be oversupplied relative to expected demand. We expect this supply surplus to persist through 2025, exacerbated by a continued OPEC+ rollback of prior output cuts. Therefore, we leave our 6-12-month WTI oil price expectation unchanged at USD 60/bbl. Yet, over a shorter 1-3-month horizon, we raise our price expectation slightly to USD 64/bbl. This is driven by a combination of expected dialling back of excessively bearish investor positioning and short-term positive sentiment from China policy stimulus. Middle East geopolitical risk remains the key upside risk to oil prices.
