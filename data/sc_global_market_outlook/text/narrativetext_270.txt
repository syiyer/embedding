Asian currencies are diverging in performance. We have revised our USD/CNH forecasts lower amid easing trade tensions and expectations of a weaker USD over a 12-month horizon. However, China is expected to gradually guide the CNH weaker to support export competitiveness. The SGD NEER is trading near the stronger end of its band (1.6% above the midpoint). Slowing inflation and rising growth concerns are adding downside pressure on the SGD, with the trade ministry cutting its 2025 GDP growth forecast and the MAS recently lowering its core inflation target. As a result, we expect the SGD NEER to ease toward the midpoint of the policy band, pushing USD/SGD higher toward the 1.32-1.34 range.
