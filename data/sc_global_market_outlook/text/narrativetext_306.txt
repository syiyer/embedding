Our stock-bond model maintained a small Overweight in global equities due to valuation and technical factors. The model’s Overweight in equities over the past two months has helped to generate an outperformance (or alpha) of 1.1%, against the 60/40 equity-bond benchmark. While year-to-date alpha remains negative at -1.3% due to a weak global equity market between late March and early April, the model’s long-term outperformance since Feb-2023 remains strong and intact, with 3.8% alpha. Our model continues to favour equities, despite weak fundamentals (slower growth and earnings). Valuations of Developed Market (DM) and Asian equities remain attractive, and a strong market breadth should continue to support the recovery in global equities.
