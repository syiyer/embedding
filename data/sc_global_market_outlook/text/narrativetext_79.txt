We view bonds as a core holding and believe it is attractive to buy high-quality bonds at current yields. Short of an unexpected inflation shock, the US 10-year government bond yield is expected to fall (i) to the 4.00-4.25% range in our base soft-landing scenario and (ii) below 4% in a hard-landing scenario. A jump in yields on the back of US fiscal deficit concerns is a key risk, highlighted by the US credit rating downgrade. However, studies of sovereign credit stress over the last few centuries argue debt imbalances can persist for long periods. This argues the case for viewing this as more of a tail risk in the absence of a trigger.
