Within global equities, we upgrade US equities to Overweight. Q1 25 earnings beat expectations, with relatively resilient forward earnings guidance. The US-China temporary tariff rollback has reduced uncertainty on the earnings outlook and we expect further de-escalation in trade talks to support earnings projections. Elevated ROE justifies elevated US valuations (12m forward P/E at 19.5% premium to global stocks). Investor positioning in US equities has risen from extreme lows but there is still has scope for further upside.
