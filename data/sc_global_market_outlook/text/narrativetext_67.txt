A sharp improvement in the near-term outlook drives our more constructive view on global equities. Our short-term (one- to three-month) technical models have turned bullish for US and China equities. This means a test, or a break above, the S&P500â€™s prior record high can be expected. Our longer-term stock-bond model has also turned modestly bullish on global equities, but this is also driven by technical (rather than fundamental) drivers. The reasonably long period between now and early July (when the US 90-day tariff pause ends) creates room for equity momentum to run further, especially if a few more trade deals are signed and Trump is able to implement his deregulation and tax agendas.
