In this scenario, Trump struggles politically, with policy gridlock stalling progress on his agenda, contributing to prolonged uncertainty. However, trade negotiations do yield results, while a scaled-down version of the tax bill eventually passes Congress. Crucially, US growth slows but escapes a recession as the Fed cuts rates from H2. Market volatility is likely to persist in the near-term, particularly as key deadlines for Trumpâ€™s 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs and the proposed tax bill converge in July. But investors who remain patient would be rewarded as resilient earnings underpin gains in the S&P 500. Our 12-month target for the S&P 500 is at 6,520, 12% higher from current levels.
