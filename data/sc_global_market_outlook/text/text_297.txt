We have been Overweight on gold since September last year, and this has served us well, with gold prices rising over 20% during this period. However, with tariff concerns easing, we see an opportunity to tactically take profit. Structural tailwinds — particularly robust central bank demand — remain intact, but signs of buyer fatigue among Asian investors, a key source of recent demand, suggest further near-term downside. That said, we view the consolidation in prices as healthy following the extended rally. With lingering trade uncertainty and rising US deficit concerns as Trump shifts his focus toward tax cuts, gold is expected to be well supported by new baseline floor price of around USD 3,000-3,100/oz.
