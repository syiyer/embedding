US trade policy has undergone three major changes over the past two months. ‘Liberation Day’ (2 April) brought higher-than-expected tariffs. Subsequently, on 9 April, Trump paused most tariffs for 90 days to focus on trade talks. More recently, the US announced the outline of a ‘deal’ with the UK and start of US-China trade talks. Markets have followed this flip-flop, with the S&P500 falling about 20% peak-to-trough at one point, before recovering most of the losses and turning positive year-to-date.
