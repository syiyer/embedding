German fiscal boost, trade thaw to limit ECB rate cuts: Europeâ€™s economic revival significantly rests on how soon the new German government implements its 12-year, EUR 500bn infrastructure spending plan (equivalent to 1% of GDP per year) and off-budget defence spending that were recently approved by the parliament. Euro area PMI data showed service sector (70% of the economy) slowed in May. However, Germany's fiscal spending plan and a US trade deal would reduce the chances of ECB rate cuts. We expect one more 25bps ECB deposit rate cut in June, followed by a long pause.
