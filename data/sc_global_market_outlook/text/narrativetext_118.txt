The US-China truce on trade has reduced the risks of a US economic hard- landing and supports a more constructive stance on risk. However, the road ahead will be bumpy, requiring careful navigation by investors. A divergence between ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ economic data has emerged — hard economic data remains resilient, while soft survey data signals fragility, raising the risk that hard data may eventually weaken. Risk assets have also priced in much of the recent optimism, and with US equity valuations again elevated, further gains will hinge on meaningful progress on trade negotiations and Trump's proposed ‘Big Beautiful (tax cut) Bill’, which we expect to dominate the market narrative in the coming months.
