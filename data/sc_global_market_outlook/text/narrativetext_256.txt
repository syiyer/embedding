EUR/USD faces downside risk in the near-term but we would accumulate on dips. We expect the EUR/USD to ease back to 1.08 over the next three months, mirroring the near-term USD rebound. However, the improving growth outlook in Germany and narrowing rate differentials can take EUR/USD to 1.14 in 12 months.
