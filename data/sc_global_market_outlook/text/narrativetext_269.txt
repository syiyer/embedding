Commodity currencies are expected to consolidate in the near term, with a modestly bullish bias over the 12-month horizon. Despite a dovish RBA, we see AUD/USD trading around 0.65 given improving risk appetite and CNY resilience. We see NZD/USD stabilising around 0.59. New Zealand's monthly inflation is gaining momentum, which will limit RBNZâ€™s room to cut rates further. Canada has largely avoided additional reciprocal tariffs. With improving factory hiring towards year-end, we expect USD/CAD to trade around 1.37 over a 12-month horizon.
