Current nominal bond yields are near the upper end of their recent range, making the risk/reward profile attractive, especially for high-quality bonds. Looking ahead, we anticipate investor focus will gradually shift from concerns over fiscal imbalances to the broader economic growth outcome. High-quality bonds can serve as a hedge against the prevailing uncertainty. Risks to our view include reduced rate cut expectations and a surge in the US deficit.
