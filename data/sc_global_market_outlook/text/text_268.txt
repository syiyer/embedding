We see GBP/USD trading around 1.31 in the near term and rise towards 1.34 over 6-12 months. Meanwhile, easing global trade tensions and fading risk aversion should support near-term upside in USD/JPY and USD/CHF. In particular, the trade-weighted CHF reached a record high in April, prompting market speculation about potential SNB intervention to weaken the currency. We see the possibility of negative Swiss interest rates by September.
