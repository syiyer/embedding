Having said that, we continue to emphasise the importance of ensuring adequate diversification across regions. We view Euro area and Asia ex-Japan equities as core holdings, with pullbacks as opportunities to rebalance. Within Asia ex-Japan, we are Overweight Chinese equities, given the additional support from domestic stimulus. We retain Indian equities as a core holding, given a possible US-India trade deal, strong earnings growth and foreign investor inflows. Both markets should benefit from a weaker USD.
