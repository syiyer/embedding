US trade deals, tax cuts and deregulation: The US-China truce and the preliminary US-UK trade deal set the tone for US talks with key partners. The UK deal suggests a 10% baseline tariff will apply to all US imports, which partly pays for proposed tax cuts. China will face a higher tariff than the baseline but not as high as 50-60% initially feared. Strategic sectors, such as steel, aluminium, autos and semiconductors, will face restrictive (higher-than-baseline) tariffs.
