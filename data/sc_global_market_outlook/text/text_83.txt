In the near term, renewed appetite for US assets and closing of earlier bearish positions should offer support for the USD. This should reduce demand for safe haven currencies, typically with low borrowing costs. However, we expect this USD bounce to be temporary. Ongoing rotation out of US assets and elevated USD valuations are likely to lead toa modestly weaker USD in the longer term.
