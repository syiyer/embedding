First is trade policy. We expect more trade deal conclusions sustaining the rally â€” especially with the 90-day tariff pause ending in early July. Second is economic data. We expect relative resilience in hard data (i.e., real economic activity) to sustain market gains, despite the recent weakness in soft sentiment data from surveys. Progress on Trump's deregulation agenda should also offer support.
