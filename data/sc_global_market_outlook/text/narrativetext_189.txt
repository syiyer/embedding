We continue to view global bonds as a core holding. In our base soft landing scenario, we expect bond returns to be supported by falling yields from current levels, helping them outperform cash which does not offer protection against lower central bank interest rates. High quality bonds should also offer diversification benefits (in a low or falling inflation outcome) particularly in a hard landing risk scenario.
