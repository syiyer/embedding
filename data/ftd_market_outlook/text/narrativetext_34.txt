From a technical perspective, gold remains in an uptrend. However, if it fails to capture and hold 2700, there is a chance of another downside test in December. The key level to watch for a downside break is 2525. A break below this level could push gold prices toward 2450. On the upside, if gold can capture the downward red trendline, which is currently just above 2700, it may start another upward leg.
