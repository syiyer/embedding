Precious metals underwent a correction in November after months of upward momentum. Gold recovered most of its losses, driven by rising geopolitical risks stemming from the Ukraine-Russia war. Silver was weaker, falling more than 6% due to the global slowdown in the manufacturing sector. Palladium erased all of October’s gains, as no progress was made on restricting Russia’s metal exports, and hopes for Trump to end the war in Ukraine faded.
