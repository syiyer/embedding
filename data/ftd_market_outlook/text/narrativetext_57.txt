USDJPY ended November just below 150. The downward pressure is evidently high due to rising expectations of a rate hike, supported by various economic data points. While the political situation has calmed for now, it remains uncertain, meaning conditions could change quickly. Overall, there is a strong possibility that 148.69 could break, triggering a sharper selloff despite the Dollar Indexâ€™s current stance.
