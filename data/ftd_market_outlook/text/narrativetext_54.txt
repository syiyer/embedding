EURUSD tested the 1.048 support level in November, a level that has only failed once since 2015, which resulted in EURUSD falling below parity. Typically, a test of 1.048 takes at least two months, so another attempt can be expected. Fundamentally, there are sufficient reasons for a break of this key support as well. However, a monthly close below this level might be required before confirming that it has truly broken. As for upward moves, they may remain selling opportunities unless the political situation in the Eurozone improves.
