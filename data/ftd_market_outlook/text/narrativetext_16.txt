The political risks have emerged at a particularly bad time. The Eurozone economy is showing signs of prolonged weakness, primarily in manufacturing, but more recently in services as well. The composite PMI has fallen to 48.1. Since 2023, the Eurozone PMI has diverged negatively compared to most other advanced economies. Germany's weakening manufacturing sector is also starting to create problems. The PMis for the UK and Japan have likewise dropped below the critical threshold of 50. In contrast, the US has clearly maintained positive divergence throughout 2024.
