Brent oil traders continue to battle within the 70-72 zone, which has become a major support level. Weak manufacturing activity and slowing global GDP are exerting significant pressure on oil prices. However, geopolitical risks, combined with OPECâ€™s delay in increasing output, are providing enough support to hold the line for now. Unless there is a shift in the economic outlook, downside pressures are likely to intensify, and Brent will most likely break below this key support level.
